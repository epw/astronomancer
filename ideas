A comet is approaching

You, the astronomancer(?), have been tasked to find out whether this
is bad, and if it is, to stop it.

You are able to listen to the stars tell you about the last times this
happened.

Some offer you something, a way to stop it potentially.

However, the ones doing the offering are dangerous and some caused the
bad things that were seen in previous visits

Right solution might be to play two or more of them off each other?

If we need much of a HUD, then make stars show up in a circle, the top
of the observatory, information can go in corners. HUD likely
unnecessary, though.

Maybe have a way to store notes? Potentially, even, revisit all the
information you've received in one place, plus add written notes of
your own? Draw lines between notes? Write links using [[syntax]]? Or
say this is a doodle, go get a piece of paper?

Might need to offer the standard timeline that everyone in their world
should know:

- Creation story about emerging from the water. Fire demon
- An ancient Sorcerer-King, short lived
- Cult of day and cult of night had a war, cult of night triumphed
  which is why we watch the stars.
- Time of peace, unified kingdom
- Kingdom falls apart, your Queen is just that of one city state


Conceit might be you're quizzing your student. Can we add another person?

Timeline:

1. The comet appears. Unluckily, there is a flood. Several cities are
wiped away, and survivors band together and settle on a mountain. This
marks the beginning of this civilization as we know it. Records and
institutional knowlege were lost, so this is the "first" occurrence of
the comet.

2. While the people have moved down into the valley next to the
mountain as no flood of a similar magnitude has occurred, the comet's
appearance is connected to stories of the flood. Several desperate
actions lead to nothing, however, someone finds a falling star and
bonds with the fire demon. No flood comes, and they claim credit. In
return are made into the Sorcerer-King. They rule cruelly, and are
eventually consumed by the fire demon, who rules through the
Sorcerer-King for a time, before being forced to seek another
host. There is chaos until a new leader can establish control, and the
fire demon becomes the source of tales.

3. Two major religions exist, a cult of the day and a cult of the
night. The cult of the day claims the comet is a bringer of evil, and
seek to prepare for it. The cult of the night believes that as the
last comet brought evil (the fire demon, still out there somewhere),
this one will bring good. This means it is a member of the cult of the
day who reaches out to the stars and finds one of the type that offers
to keep talking to you in return for services, and can occasionally
manifest things. These stars are explicitly anti-humanity, instead of
simply power-hungry like fire demons. As such, the two cults end up
going to war. The cult of the night eventually wins by gaining an
astronomancer who figures out which stars are safe to listen to, and
gets the information they need.

4. The fire demon acquires a new host and causes chaos. In the tense
atmosphere of the comet's apperance, this leads to many things being
blamed on the comet. The unified kingdom dissolves into many small
city states, and the monarch simply rules the biggest one. The fire
demon begins to consolidate power again.

5. Present day. The fire demon is going to try to become the
Sorcerer-King again (or, if it manages to take over the current ruler,
Sorcerer-Queen)

You are the royal astronomancer. While your people know the stars and
watch them, you have learned to listen to them as well. You are tasked
to find out what they have to say that could help your people and your
Queen.

(Later:

The master who came before you passed peacefully, but warned you that
many of your calling did not meet so simple a fate. There are some
stars who will make offers, and listen to you in return. To speak with
them is fine, but any who accept their gifts, or their deals, is
undertaking a grave risk.
)

## Information from your master:

- Stars never lie. However, they actually don't see everything. The
  dangerous ones have motivations.

## Morning star (first star, demos UI. Then rest of stars fade in.):

I have seen this comet pass through your sky time and time again, with
[seven generations separating times]. At those times have come fires,
a flood, wars and tyrants, the fall of a kingdom. Danger is at your
doorstep once more.

(about 12 stars?)

## Star

(visit 1)

I once saw a flood at the time of the comet. A drought had left the
land parched and hard, unable to absorb. The river had worn down its
banks. The comet was no cause, but no-one could forget how it stood in
the sky while houses sank, horses fled, and how the few survivors
traveled on rafts until they reached the Mountain. Their children and
their children's children feared the valley in case it flooded again,
but younger generations told each other it was the comet's fault, and
as it had not been seen again, the valley was safe.

## Star

(visit 1)

Before any of your stories, there were kingdoms scattered like fallen
leaves here. The flood that came when the comet did left so few, and
washed away so much, that you became one people, who knew of little
before the waters.

## Star

(visit 2)

The first comet after the flood was a cause of panic. It seemed that
the hubris of returning to the valley was about to lead to destruction
by flood again. I saw the people reach out, desperate for anything to
save them. One man found one of my cousins, falling towards him as he
strove. Their lives joined, and the new Sorcerer-King told the fearful
he had banished the waters and demanded their allegiance.

## Star

(visit 2)

Beware the stars that fall to your world. The Sorcerer-King found one,
and while the powers it wielded for him let him claim he had held the
flood at bay when the comet came, it consumed him from the
inside. When there was nothing left, the fallen star fled, to seek
another it could inhabit, heedless of the collapsing monarchy it left
behind.

## Star

(visit 3)

When the Sorcerer-King was just a distant memory, there were those
among you who looked to our home and asked for blessings of the
night. They did not believe the dark sky would send the Sorcerer-King
and his demon with one comet and not bring balance with another, so
they did not fear its arrival. They were surprised when evil did
arrive, in the form of their own neighbors who worshipped the bright
day and feared the comet. But, they began to learn to listen to what
we had to say, and as such we warned them of what was coming.

## Star

(visit 3)

Tales of the Sorcerer-King's demon kept some frightened of the
night. They whispered of how it waited in the wilderness for the lost
and the desperate, and gave them fire, then laughed as it consumed
them. They turned to the Sun and begged for help. If the comet had not
destroyed them last time, they feared, it would at its next
appearance. One among them, believing too little had been done, pushed
through his fear and searched us for answers. With no-one else to talk
to about it, he ignored our warnings and found one willing to say what
he wanted to hear. It told him he could be strong, and those who
followed the night were weak. All it truly wanted was death.

## Star

(visit 4)

The fallen star knows the comet brings fear, even though the followers
of the night prevailed against the day and all now learn to watch
us. The vengeful one it made into a new sorcerer allowed it to disrupt
the delicate calm that had settled since the war. In return, she
taught it to feed on dynasties, not individuals.
