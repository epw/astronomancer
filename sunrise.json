You contemplate the stars, and watch closely as the first glow of the sunrise appears.","Line2":"When the star falls, it appears as a trail of beautiful, sparkling gems, so much closer and faster-moving than the comet. It's strangely quiet, until, like a crack of thunder, it gets very loud.","Line3":"The blast of air knocks you off your feet, so you hear the motion from the center of the crater before you see it. A burning core, a stone aflame like a log, sits at the center.","Line4":"As you look at it, it beckons to you in your mind. When you reach out to touch it, it burns, but not too badly to be held. You feel your hearts link; you know what you have become capable of.","Size":5,"type":"Speech"},"Node13":{"Line0":"./pact","type":"Condition"},"Node14":{"Line0":"The star you reached, whatever else its goals, could only be hostile to life itself. Wherever you saw its influence, people suffered. You used your newfound abilities to protect your people as best you could.","Line1":"Travelers from nearby lands told your Queen that the Sorcerers in the neighboring kingdom had been planning an invasion, but sudden, unexpected misfortunes had begun to hamper their efforts, and their time was now spent combatting these.","Line2":"When the comet had vanished, the star spoke to you once more, demanding the sacrifice it was owed. You offer up the fallen star, as you felt how its use drained your life force, and nothing could fit the conditions of your bargain better.","Size":3,"type":"Speech"},"Node15":{"Line0":"Who can say whether the comet was in some way the true bringer of the doom that followed?","Line1":"Whatever the truth, when the Sorcerers of the neighboring kingdom used their demonic powers to lead the battle, you were there to meet them.","Line2":"They were more skilled than you, though the powers were similar. You saw how they know how to work in tandem with the demon, and how it played off their strengths.","Line3":"To protect your homeland, you were forced to draw on the fallen star, your own demon, more and more. It burned you deeper with each desperate move.","Line4":"The lengths you went to did turn the tide. The Sorcerers found the city not worth taking with such resistance, and departed.","Size":5,"type":"Speech"},"Node16":{"Line0":"Soon, your life force burned up by the fallen star, you succumbed.","Line1":"In future years, the people will speak of your heroic efforts, rebuffing the Sorcerer Dynasty.","Line2":"And they will speak of the demon that came with the comet, to lurk in the shadows, emerging to bring ruin when hearts grow weak and desperation rises.","Size":3,"type":"Speech"},"Node17":{"Line0":"In the years to come, the comet's appearance is remembered as a time of hardship, but not of ruin.

A dark age, with survivors struggling to hold out against the night, followed.","Line3":"When the comet had vanished, the star spoke to you once more, demanding the sacrifice it was owed.
